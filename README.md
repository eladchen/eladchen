I am a full-stack software engineer, and owner of the [abstracter](https://github.com/abstracter-io) org. I love programming, writing, speaking and traveling.

I love coding, especially Javascript and Java, which allows me to solve challenging problems.
As a tech leader, I want to inspire others to write effecient code and build the best products possible. There's nothing like having
the opportunity to make something work and grow as a team. That's what makes me proud of what I do.
